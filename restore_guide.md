# How to Restore from Backup

If you need to rollback to a previous version, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Backup:**
   Go to the `backups/` folder inside your `coppy-web` directory.
   Find the zip file with the version/date you want (e.g., `coppy-web-v1.1.0-20231217_090000.zip`).

2. **Unzip the Backup:**
   - **Mac:** Double-click the .zip file. It will create a folder.
   
3. **Replace Files:**
   - Copy all files from the unzipped folder.
   - Paste them into your main `coppy-web` folder, replacing the existing files.

4. **Restart:**
   - Refresh your browser or restart the server app to ensure the old version is loaded.
